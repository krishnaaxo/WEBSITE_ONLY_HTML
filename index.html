    <h2>What is Mixed martial arts (MMA)?</h2>
    <hr color="#16a085" />

    <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:18px">Mixed martial arts (MMA), hybrid combat sport incorporating techniques from<strong style="color:red"> boxing, wrestling, judo, jujitsu, karate, Muay Thai (Thai boxing), </strong> and other disciplines. Although it was initially decried by critics
        as a brutal blood sport without rules, MMA gradually shed its no-holds-barred image and emerged as one of the world’s fastest-growing spectator sports in the early 21st century. MMA events are sanctioned in many countries and in all 50 U.S. states.
        During the early 20th century, various <strong>interstylistic</strong> contests took place throughout Japan and in the countries of the Four Asian Tigers. In Brazil, there was the sport of Vale Tudo, in which fighters from various styles fought
        with little to no rules. The Gracie family was known to promote Vale Tudo matches as a way to promote their own Brazilian jiu-jitsu style.[7] In the West, the concept of combining elements of multiple martial arts was popularized by Bruce Lee's
        Jeet Kune Do during the late 1960s to early 1970s. A precursor to modern MMA was the 1976 Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki bout, fought between boxer Muhammad Ali and wrestler Antonio Inoki in Japan, where it later inspired the foundation of Pancrase
        in 1993 and Pride Fighting Championships in 1997.</p>

    <h2>History of MMA</h2>
    <hr color="#16a085" />

    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">
        Mixed martial arts was believed to date back to the ancient Olympic Games in 648 BCE, when pankration—the martial training of Greek armies—was considered the combat sport of ancient Greece. The brutal contest combined wrestling, boxing, and street fighting.
        Kicking and hitting a downed opponent were allowed; only biting and eye gouging were forbidden. A match ended when one of the fighters acknowledged defeat or was rendered unconscious. In some cases, competitors died during matches. Pankration
        became one of the most popular events of the ancient Olympics. In 393 CE Roman emperor Theodosius I banned the Olympic Games, spelling the end of pankration as a popular sport. However, this style of fighting later resurfaced in the 20th century
        in Brazil via a combat sport known as vale tudo (“anything goes”). It was popularized by brothers Carlos and Hélio Gracie, who began a jujitsu school in Rio de Janeiro in 1925. The siblings garnered attention by issuing the “Gracie Challenge”
        in area newspapers, proclaiming in advertisements: “If you want a broken arm, or rib, contact Carlos Gracie.” The brothers would take on all challengers, and their matches, which resembled those of pankration, became so popular that they had to
        be moved to large soccer (association football) stadiums to accommodate the crowds.

    <h2>Rules and regulations</h2>
    <hr color="#16a085" />

    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">
        The UFC was instrumental in pushing for a set of rules to standardize the sport globally, and by 2009 regulatory bodies in the United States and many fighting promotions worldwide had adopted standards known as the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts.
        Under these rules, MMA participants compete in a ring or a fenced area, and they fight using padded fingerless gloves but do not wear shoes or headgear. They may strike, throw, kick, or grapple with an opponent, and attacks may be launched either
        from a standing position or on the ground. However, head butting, gouging (thrusting a finger or thumb into an opponent’s eye), biting, hair pulling, and groin attacks of any kind are prohibited. Downward elbow strikes, throat strikes, and strikes
        to the spine or to the back of the head are also illegal, as are certain attacks against a grounded opponent, including kicking or kneeing the head. If a fighter violates a rule, the referee may issue a warning, deduct points, or—particularly
        when a flagrant foul is deemed to have been committed—disqualify the offending contestant.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">
        Under the Unified Rules, non-championship MMA fights consist of three five-minute rounds, with a one-minute break between each round. Championship bouts are set for five rounds. A fighter can win a bout by knocking out the other fighter or by forcing
        an opponent to submit (either by tapping with his hand or verbally indicating that he has had enough). If a fight goes the distance, however, the winner is decided by a panel of three judges, using boxing’s 10-point must system (the winner of
        the round gets 10 points; the loser is awarded nine or fewer points). In the United States, MMA referees and judges are assigned by state athletic commissions, which also conduct medical and drug tests on fighters.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">
        Weight classes in MMA vary by region or organization. The UFC currently recognizes a total of nine weight classes in men’s MMA. The upper weight limits of these classes are as follows: strawweight, 115 pounds (52 kg); flyweight, 125 pounds (57 kg); bantamweight,
        135 pounds (61 kg); featherweight, 145 pounds (66 kg); lightweight, 155 pounds (70 kg); welterweight, 170 pounds (77 kg); middleweight, 185 pounds (84 kg); light heavyweight, 205 pounds (93 kg); and heavyweight, 265 pounds (120 kg). While the
        UFC has no formal super heavyweight division for fighters weighing more than 265 pounds, some MMA organizations recognize the weight class.
    </p>

    <h2>Organization of the sport</h2>
    <hr color="#16a085" />

    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">
        On the professional level, the UFC, based in Las Vegas, Nevada, is MMA’s leading promoter. It produces dozens of live events each year, and its pay-per-view cable television broadcasts have reached viewers in some 130 countries around the world. The organization,
        founded in 1993, was purchased by Zuffa Inc. in January 2001 for $2 million and quickly expanded. UFC President Dana White soon became the face of the sport. In 2016 it was announced that the UFC was being sold to the talent agency WME-IMG for
        $4 billion.


    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">
        In 2006 the UFC moved to capitalize on the sport’s growing popularity by buying other MMA organizations, including the World Fighting Alliance (WFA) and World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC). In 2007 the UFC also purchased the Japan-based Pride Fighting Championships
        (known as Pride). The UFC disbanded the WFA, acquiring top WFA fighters such as Quinton (“Rampage”) Jackson, but continued to operate the WEC as a distinct entity until 2010. The UFC had planned to have Pride and UFC champions meet annually in
        a so-called Super Bowl of mixed martial arts, but the Pride purchase proved to be problematic. Though Pride ultimately was also disbanded, the UFC did take on a number of top Pride fighters.
